The important thing to note is, at any particular step both traversals will be in same row as in all possible three moves, row number is increased.  Let (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) denote current positions of first and second traversals respectively. Thus at any time x1 will be equal to x2 as both of them move forward but variation is possible along y. Since variation in y could occur in 3 ways no change (y), go left (y &#8211; 1), go right (y + 1). So in total 9 combinations among y1, y2 are possible.

        "How to get number of subsets for a given GCD &#8216;i&#8217; where i lies in range from 1 to arrMax.  The idea is to count all multiples of i using &#8216;freq&#8217; built in step 2.  Let there be &#8216;add&#8217; multiples of i. The number of all possible subsets with &#8216;add&#8217; numbers would be &#8220;pow(2, add) &#8211; 1&#8243;, excluding the empty set.  For example, if given array is {2, 3, 6} and i = 3, there are 2 multiples of 3 (3 and 6).  So there will be 3 subsets {3}, {3, 6} and {6} which have a multiple of i as GCD.  These subsets also include {6} which doesn&#8217;t have 3 as GCD, but a multiple of 3. So we need to subtract such subsets.  We store subset counts for every GCD in another hash map &#8216;subset&#8217;.  Let &#8216;sub&#8217; be the number of subsets which have multiple of &#8216;i&#8217; as GCD.  The value of &#8216;sub&#8217; for any multiple of &#8216;i&#8217; can directly be obtained from subset[] as we are evaluating counts from arrMax to 1.</p>\n",

In this case, the outer find is called for every element, but we go inside the if condition only for the smallest element.

        "Suppose we have a collection of elements which are numbered from 1 to&#160;N. If we want to represent a subset of this set than it can be encoded by a sequence of&#160;N&#160;bits (we usually call this sequence a &#8220;mask&#8221;). In our chosen subset the i-th element belongs to it if and only if the&#160;i-th bit of the mask I set i.e., it equals to 1. For example, the mask 10000101&#160;means that the subset of the set&#160;[1&#8230; 8]&#160;consists of elements 1, 3 and 8. We know that for a set of N elements there are total 2<sup>N</sup> subsets thus 2<sup>N</sup> masks are possible, one representing each subset. Each mask is in fact an integer number written in binary notation.</p>\n",
        "<p>Our main methodology is to assign a value to each mask (and, therefore, to each subset) and thus calculate the values for new masks using values of the already computed masks. Usually our main target is to calculate value/solution for the complete set i.e., for mask 11111111.  Normally, to find the value for a subset&#160;X&#160;we remove an element in every possible way and use values for obtained subsets&#160;X&#8217;<sub>1</sub>, X&#8217;<sub>2</sub>&#8230; ,X&#8217;<sub>k</sub>&#160;to compute the value/solution for&#160;X. This means that the values for&#160;X&#8217;<sub>i</sub>&#160;must have been computed already, so we need to establish an ordering in which masks will be considered. It&#8217;s easy to see that the natural ordering will do: go over masks in increasing order of corresponding numbers. Also, We sometimes, start with the empty subset X and we add elements in every possible way and use the values of obtained subsets X&#8217;<sub>1</sub>, X&#8217;<sub>2</sub>&#8230; ,X&#8217;<sub>k</sub> to compute the value/solution for&#160;X.</p>\n",
