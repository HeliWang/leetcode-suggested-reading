# Leetcode + geeksforgeeks

## Idea

This project suggests three articles to read on geeksforgeeks.org given a problem on leetcode.com.

## How It Works

It works by getting a similarity score, more specifically, the cosine similarity of two titiles.


## Limitations

Leetcode titles (2sum, 3sum for instance) tend to be short and therefore sometimes result in unsatisfactory results.

## TODO

1. preprocess titles of leetcode problems when needed.  
2. add a short description from the problems and articles to improve the accuracy.  
3. improve the efficiency of the script.
